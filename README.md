## Project 2

The process of writing this program improved my ability of working with a modular and OOP mindset. Instead of attempting to create the project from the ground up, it was better to see the whole scope of the project and work from the top down. When it came to handling and sorting items in the database, sorting them into classes and functions made organizing and accessing much easier, with something like getting and setting methods in each class. This modularity is crucial for managing multiple and individual items in the database.
